When using a C-function, in particular the minimum, they can be expressed as a nonsmooth system, for which globalization is important. The Bouligand differential of the minimum is actually related to a problem from combinatorial geometry, hyperplane arrangements. We improved one of the main algorithms to obtain the chambers of an arrangement and showed some theoretical properties of arrangements through the prism of convex analysis and duality.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Webpage of Baptiste Plaquevent-Jourdain","summary":"I am a PhD student at Université de Sherbrooke, in the BISOUS team (in French), and at Inria Paris, in the SERENA team, supervised by Jean-Pierre Dussault (Sherbrooke) and Jean Charles Gilbert (Paris) since April 2021.","title":"Current situation"},{"content":"Posters # Nonsmooth OPTimization and Applications (NOPTA), Antwerpen, Belgium, April 2024, \u0026ldquo;A Differentiability Problem solved by Discrete Geometry\u0026rdquo;.
