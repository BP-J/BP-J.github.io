See also the associate article PDF. Work done with Jean Charles Gilbert and Jean-Pierre Dussault.\nISF - BDIFFMIN is a MATLAB set of functions that computes the Bouligand differential of the minimum of two affine functions. This computation arose from the use of the (componentwise) minimum on a Linear Complementarity Problem:\n\\[x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mapsto F(x) := \\min(Ax+a, Bx+b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m.\\quad (\\mathrm{LCP})\\]\nLet \\(\\mathcal{E} := \\{i \\in [1:m] : (Ax+a)_i = (Bx+b)_i\\}\\), \\(p := |\\mathcal{E}|\\) and let\n\\(V = (B_{\\mathcal{E},:} - A_{\\mathcal{E},:})^{\\mathsf{T}}\\), one has \\(\\partial_B F(x) \\Longleftrightarrow \\mathcal{S}(V)\\)\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{S}(V) := \\{s \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}^p : \\exists\\ d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n, s \\cdot V^{\\mathsf{T}} d \u0026gt; 0 \\} \\)\nThe name ISF, for Incremental Sign Feasibility, is a description of the algorithm employed, initially designed by Rada and Černý in this article.\nThis computation is done by determining the chambers of the related central hyperplane arrangement. Other equivalent problems can also be dealt with by ISF, such as\nenumerating the orthants encountered by the null space of a matrix, knowing the pointed cones generated by a set of vectors (and their opposites), finding the possible partitions in two subsets by a hyperplane of a set of points. ISF (Julia) #This software is a direct \u0026lsquo;descendant\u0026rsquo; of the MATLAB version. It is in progress and aims at dealing with arbitrary arrangements. since it is developped in Julia, it possesses additional features such as computations in rational number and more algorithmical variants.

When using a C-function, in particular the minimum, they can be expressed as a nonsmooth system, for which globalization is important. The Bouligand differential of the minimum is actually related to a problem from combinatorial geometry, hyperplane arrangements. We improved one of the main algorithms to obtain the chambers of an arrangement and showed some theoretical properties of arrangements through the prism of convex analysis and duality.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Webpage of Baptiste Plaquevent-Jourdain","summary":"I am a PhD student at Université de Sherbrooke, in the BISOUS team (in French), and at Inria Paris, in the SERENA team, supervised by Jean-Pierre Dussault (Sherbrooke) and Jean Charles Gilbert (Paris) since April 2021.","title":"Current situation"},{"content":"Posters # Nonsmooth OPTimization and Applications (NOPTA), Antwerpen, Belgium, April 2024, \u0026ldquo;A Differentiability Problem solved by Discrete Geometry\u0026rdquo;.
