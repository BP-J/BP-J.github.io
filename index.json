See also the associate article PDF. Work done with Jean Charles Gilbert and Jean-Pierre Dussault.\nISF - BDIFFMIN is a MATLAB set of functions that computes the Bouligand differential of the minimum of two affine functions. This computation arose from the use of the (componentwise) minimum on a Linear Complementarity Problem:\n\\[x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mapsto F(x) := \\min(Ax+a, Bx+b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m.\\quad (\\mathrm{LCP})\\]\nLet \\(\\mathcal{E} := \\{i \\in [1:m] : (Ax+a)_i = (Bx+b)_i\\}\\), \\(p := |\\mathcal{E}|\\) and let\n\\(V = (B_{\\mathcal{E},:} - A_{\\mathcal{E},:})^{\\mathsf{T}}\\), one has \\(\\partial_B F(x) \\Longleftrightarrow \\mathcal{S}(V)\\)\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{S}(V) := \\{s \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}^p : \\exists\\ d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n, s \\cdot V^{\\mathsf{T}} d \u0026gt; 0 \\} \\)\nThe name ISF, for Incremental Sign Feasibility, is a description of the algorithm employed, initially designed by Rada and Černý in this article.\nThis computation is done by determining the chambers of the related central hyperplane arrangement. Other equivalent problems can also be dealt with by ISF, such as\nenumerating the orthants encountered by the null space of a matrix, knowing the pointed cones generated by a set of vectors (and their opposites), finding the possible partitions in two subsets by a hyperplane of a set of points.

When using a C-function, in particular the minimum, they can be expressed as a nonsmooth system, for which globalization of local methods such as the Newton-min algorithm is important.\nThe Bouligand differential of the minimum, which may intervene in such approaches is actually related to a problem from combinatorial geometry called hyperplane arrangements.
